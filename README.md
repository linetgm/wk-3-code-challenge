# Title
Flatdango Movie Theater

# Description
 *Flatdango Movie Theater is a web application that allows users to purchase movie tickets from the theater.
 *Users can view movie details, such as the poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.  *They can also select a movie from the menu and update the movie details accordingly.

# Project Setup

1. Create a new project folder on your local machine.
2. Clone the GitHub repository to your project folder.
3. Make sure you have a local server running to serve the JSON data. You can use JSON Server for this purpose.
4. Update the URLs in the `script.js` file to point to the correct endpoints on your local server.
5. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Core Deliverables

As user can;

1. See the first movie's details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets when the page loads.
2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page.
3. Buy a ticket for a movie, and the number of available tickets will decrease on the frontend.

# File Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the movie details and film menu.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styling for the web page.
- `d.json`: The JSON file that contains the movie data.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that fetches data from the server and updates the DOM.

## Technologies Used

The project uses the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the web page.
- JavaScript: Programming language for client-side interactions and DOM manipulation.
- JSON Server: Local server for serving the JSON data.
